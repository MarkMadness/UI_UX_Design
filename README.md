# UI_UX_Design Live Project
## Introduction
For two weeks, I worked on creating a logo and designing a home page for a construction company. By the end of the project, I deliverd a logo, mockups, and a prototype of the 
approved mockup. With a color palette already established, I worked in Adobe Photoshop working on three concepts of the company logo. After logo2.jpg was chosen, I went to making 
three wireframes of the home page concepting a prefered layout keeping in mind the content that the clinet wanted on the home page. When Wireframe3.jpg was chosen by the client, 
I proceded with using template images and filling in color for three mockups so the client could have a better picture of what the finalized version of their home page would look 
like. Finally, with mockup1.jpg I took the photoshop file into Adobe XD and made a prototype of the page's reactive/interactive elements showcasing the user's interaction with 
the homepage.
